# Personal roadmap

This is a personal collection without the intent to contain everything or to recruit the greatest programmers with that. If you are interested in professional and finished roadmaps, please check [this github page](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). I plan to update this little project frequently, so updates and design fixes will be coming soon, if you look back. If you like it, you can use freely the entire image or just a part of it, how you want, without mentioning me or the github page (it's your decision).

### Important
I recommend this roadmap for autoeducative beginners who are curious about the different directions in this profession or want to test herself/himself about what she/he knows and to evaluate what comes next. Always try to figure out first if the new thing you plan to learn will help you and what are its potentials. DO NOT follow the same direction you see on the image and skip the parts you do not need!

### Why do I do this?
0. Most of the knowledge I have acquired in computer science I learned from the internet. Currently I'm learning day by day from awesome websites. It's still too few to give something back from it, but if you find this interesting in any way, use this picture and information how you want.
1. It's quite frustrating when I try to learn or understand something. I hardly always find out that there is a basic notion, principle, methodology or a know-how thing that I don't yet understand or know. Thank you my computer science university :kissing_heart:. As a result I took the decision to learn by myself and figure out basic things as a starting point to see the building blocks. This image maybe will serve as a reminder for the building blocks I am collecting now.
2. In developer communities sometimes it can be hard to understand everything at a concept level at least, just because I'm not familiar with a word for example. So everytime I see a notion, principle, methodology, pattern, book, anything important, I write it down, learn it later and see if I can include it in the image.
3. I asked myself some time ago how a general "should-know" roadmap would look like for the past version of me and I realized that it's not an easy story to write or tell. Based on that question this project might be an interesting experiment.
